== Testing the app in a computer ==

=== OPTION 1 === 

Requeriments: Google Chrome browser + Ripple mobile enviroment emulator plugin (http://ripple.tinyhippos.com/)

You must run Google Chrome in Unsafe mode adding this params: --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security

IMPORTANT: I strong recommend you to create a new link or application launch called "Google Unsafe" and use it only for testing the app

 "Path to chrome\chrome.exe" --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security

Open the index.html file in the Google Chrome unsafe and click on the Ripple icon to activate the emulator

Once opened in the Ripple settings block change Cross Domain Proxy to Disabled

Please note that some functionallities (camera, audio recording, contact) will not work in the emulator

=== OPTION 2 === 

Install the Android, BlackBerry or iPhone SDK and follow instructions in http://phonegap.com/start/
